        <p>The Mona Lisa is a 16th-century oil painting by Leonardo da Vinci, considered the world's most famous and recognized artwork. It depicts Lisa Gherardini, an Italian noblewoman, in a revolutionary, forward-facing pose, renowned for its subject's enigmatic smile and masterful sfumato technique. After being acquired by the king of France, the painting has been housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, where its global fame surged after being stolen in 1911 and recovered two years later. </p>
